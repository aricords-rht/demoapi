# demoapi
## Demo of a JSON based REST API, in Laravel
The website is up and running at [http://ec2-3-14-142-68.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/api](http://ec2-3-14-142-68.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/api)

Started a new github account, AWS account, EC2 instance, MySQL database, and apache server for this project. Next steps would be to secure it with a proper domain, ELB instance, and SSL Cert. This was not done for time considerations.
